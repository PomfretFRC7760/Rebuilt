# 2026 REBUILT Programming Workbook
## Project Migration: From 2025 Reefscape to 2026 REBUILT

---

## Overall Overview

**Current Status**: Codebase is written for the 2025 game (Reefscape) and needs complete migration to the 2026 game (REBUILT)

**Key Differences**:=
- 2025: Coral, Algae, Reef
- 2026: FUEL, HUB, TOWER

---

## Priority 1: Critical Terminology and Naming Updates

### 1.1 Global Renaming
- [x] **Rename all "Coral" → "Fuel"**
  - `CoralIntake.java` → `FuelIntake.java`
  - `CoralJettison.java` → `FuelJettison.java`
  - `CoralAutoPosition.java` → `FuelAutoPosition.java`
  - All variable names: `coral` → `fuel`
  - All comments and documentation strings

- [x] **Rename all "Algae" → "Fuel"**
  - `AlgaeLocator.java` → `FuelLocator.java`
  - `AlgaeLocatorCommand.java` → `FuelLocatorCommand.java`
  - All variable names: `algae` → `fuel`
  - Note: Both Algae and Coral are FUEL in 2026, need to unify

- [x] **Update location system terminology**
  - `Reef` → `HUB`
  - `ReefSticks` → `HubPositions` or similar
  - `getReefLocation()` → `getHubLocation()`
  - `getAlgaeReefLocation()` → `getFuelLocation()`

### 1.2 File Renaming
- [x] Rename all related Java files
- [x] Update all import statements
- [x] Update all references

---

## Priority 2: Field and Location System Updates

### 2.1 AprilTag Field Layout
- [x] **Update AprilTag field layout**
  - `Locations.java` line 62: `AprilTagFields.k2025ReefscapeAndyMark` → `AprilTagFields.k2026Rebuilt`
  - Verify all AprilTag IDs are correct (2026 uses IDs 1-32)
  - Update all AprilTag position references

### 2.2 Location System Refactoring
- [x] **Update starting positions**
  - `blueStarts[]` and `redStarts[]` in `Locations.java` and `AutoLocation.java` updated to 2026 field coordinates
  - Field: 16.518 m × 8.043 m (from 2026-rebuilt-andymark.json)
  - ROBOT STARTING LINE: 158.6 in (4.028 m) from alliance wall; `getStartingLoc()` uses same constants

- [x] **Update HUB positions**
  - HUB positions driven by AprilTag layout (2.1); 158.6 in from wall per game manual
  - `getHub()`, `getHubLocation()`, `getFuelLocation()` use 2026 HUB tags

- [x] **Update DEPOT / collection**
  - Gather stations mapped to OUTPOST (tags 13,14 red; 29,30 blue); `getBargeLoc()` uses OUTPOST

- [x] **Update TOWER positions**
  - TOWER mapped to tags 15,16 red; 31,32 blue; `getProcLoc()` updated in 2.1

- [x] **Delete/update no longer relevant positions**
  - Barge → OUTPOST, Processor → TOWER; Reef removed in Priority 1

### 2.3 Location Chooser Updates
- [x] **Update `LocationChooser.java`**
  - `HubPositions` enum and `selectFuelLocation()` already done in P1
  - A–L are 2026 HUB positions; PROCESSOR=TOWER, BARGE=OUTPOST; NONE handled to avoid NPE
  - Class comment added for 2026 REBUILT

- [x] **Update `Locations.java`**
  - Location methods adapted in 2.1 (AprilTag IDs) and 2.2 (starting positions, constants)
  - `getHubLocation()` / `getFuelLocation()` use 2026 HUB tags; halfRobot* offsets kept (robot-relative)
